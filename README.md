# Seneca: Secure ENvironment for Encrypted Credential Authentication

Seneca is a research-driven project aimed at developing a decentralized credential lifecycle management system using advanced cryptographic techniques. The project focuses on two primary components: Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) for decentralized credential issuance and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for privacy-preserving verification of credentials. This work is part of ongoing PhD research exploring secure and decentralized methods for managing digital credentials.

## Overview

The Seneca project integrates the following core components:

### Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)
Seneca employs Threshold Signature Schemes to decentralize the credential issuance process. TSS allows a distributed group of issuers to collaboratively sign credentials without any single issuer holding complete control. This approach enhances the security and trustworthiness of the credentialing system by eliminating single points of failure.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are utilized in Seneca to enable the privacy-preserving verification of credentials. With ZKP, users can prove the validity of their credentials without revealing any additional information, ensuring that personal data remains secure during the verification process. This component is crucial for maintaining user anonymity while still providing verifiable claims.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Issuance**: Utilizing TSS to ensure that credentials are issued through a collaborative process involving multiple issuers.
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Leveraging ZKP to allow for anonymous verification of claims, protecting user privacy.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Designed to be scalable and applicable across various credentialing scenarios and industries.
