# Decentralized Issuer with Threshold Signatures

This project is part of ongoing research within the Seneca framework, aiming to develop a secure and decentralized credential issuance system using threshold signatures. The work focuses on enhancing the resilience of decentralized issuers by distributing private key control across multiple entities, ensuring that no single point of failure can compromise the system.

## Motivation

Single Certificate Authorities (CAs) are vulnerable to attacks, as evidenced by incidents like the DigiNotar breach. In centralized systems, both holders and verifiers are forced to rely on the integrity of a single CA. If a private key is compromised, it can lead to the issuance of malicious certificates. This project seeks to mitigate such risks by decentralizing private key management using threshold signatures.

## Goal

The primary goal is to distribute private key control among multiple entities, ensuring that even if some entities are compromised, the system remains secure. Signatures are collaboratively generated by a consortium of entities, with verification performed using a single public key in a DID document. The project explores how universities and other institutions can participate in such a consortium, including the process for adding new members and regenerating private keys.

## Solution

The solution involves integrating the goals into the existing Issuer, Holder, and Verifier configuration, utilizing OID4VC (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials) and Verifiable Credentials. The project will evaluate the use of Schnorr or ECDSA signatures, with a focus on justifying the choice of cryptographic algorithm based on security and performance considerations.

## Implementation and Prototype

The project includes a StudentID Card prototype as a use case to evaluate the application of threshold signatures within a decentralized credential management system. The feasibility of modifying the existing Resum√© App to support the StudentID VC use case will be explored.

## Evaluation

The evaluation phase will focus on assessing the performance and security of the implemented threshold signature scheme, particularly in the context of a decentralized issuer. Specific metrics and evaluation criteria will be defined as part of the milestone plan.

## Milestones

A milestone plan is being developed, with the objective to complete the project by December. Key milestones include the finalization of the thesis structure, title, and content, as well as the development and evaluation of the StudentID Card prototype.
