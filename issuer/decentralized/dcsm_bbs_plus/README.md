### **1. Project Setup**

- **Objective**: Implement and evaluate a Threshold BBS+ Signature scheme for a decentralized issuer consortium to issue and manage verifiable credentials.
- **Scope**: The project will cover threshold key generation, signature issuance, verification, and decentralized status management using IPFS, DHT, Blockchain, and Merkle Trees. It will also integrate different DID methods for comparison.

### **2. Key Components**

#### **2.1 Threshold BBS+ Signatures**

- **Goal**: Enable a subset of consortium members to sign credentials, ensuring security and privacy collaboratively.
- **Approach**: Implement a three-round signing protocol similar to Sparkle+, adapted for BBS+ signatures:
    - **Round 1**: Commitment phase where each participant commits to a nonce.
    - **Round 2**: Reveal phase where nonces are revealed and signed.
    - **Round 3**: Signature aggregation and verification.
      (TODO: Two round possible?)

#### **2.2 Decentralized Credential Status Management**

- **IPFS**: Store credential data and metadata in a decentralized file system.
- **DHT**: Use for efficient lookup of credential records.
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: Record status changes for tamper-proof logging.
- **Merkle Trees**: Optimize storage of credential status changes.

#### **2.3 Decentralized Identifier (DID) Integration**

- Integrate three DID methods for the consortium and its members:
    - **DID:ion (Bitcoin-based)**
    - **DID:ethr (Ethereum-based)**
    - **DID:web (Web-based)**

### **3. Benchmark System**

#### **3.1 Dataset Description**

- Create a synthetic dataset simulating consortium credential issuance and management scenarios.
- Include various credentials (e.g., academic degrees, certifications) with different credential lifecycle events (issued, revoked, suspended).
- Ensure the dataset includes diverse DID methods to test interoperability.

#### **3.2 Evaluation Framework**

- Develop metrics to evaluate the performance and security of the system:
    - **Performance Metrics**: Latency of credential issuance and verification, throughput of transactions per second.
    - **Scalability Metrics**: Ability to handle increasing credentials and consortium members.
    - **Interoperability Metrics**: Compatibility across different DID methods.

### **4. Implementation Steps**

#### **4.1 Threshold Key Generation**

- Implement distributed key generation (DKG) using Shamir Secret Sharing.

#### **4.2 Signing Protocol**

- Develop the three-round signing protocol for BBS+ signatures.

#### **4.3 Verification Process**

- Implement signature verification, ensuring validity under the shared public key.

#### **4.4 Credential Status Management**

- Integrate IPFS for storing credential data.
- Use DHT for locating records efficiently.
- Implement blockchain anchoring to record status changes.
- Use Merkle Trees to optimize storage and verify status updates.

#### **4.5 DID Integration**

- Implement support for DID:ion by interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain layer.
- Integrate DID:ethr by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts.
- Develop support for DID:web by utilizing HTTP-based identifiers.

### **5. Security Section**

#### **5.1 Security Assumptions**

- Assume secure communication channels between consortium members.
- Assume honest majority among consortium members for threshold operations.

#### **5.2 Attack Vectors**

- Consider attacks on key management (e.g., key leakage or compromise).
- Evaluate resilience against network-based attacks on IPFS or DHT nodes.
- Analyze potential insider threats within the consortium.

### **6. Testing and Validation**

- Write comprehensive unit tests covering all cryptographic operations, DID integrations, and status management functionalities.
- Test the system under various scenarios, including malicious attempts to ensure robustness.

### **7. Deployment Considerations**

#### **7.1 Infrastructure Setup with Terraform**

- Use Terraform to automate the setup of decentralized architectures across cloud platforms.
- Define infrastructure as code to ensure reproducibility and scalability.

#### **7.2 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

- Set up a Git-based CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- Ensure that new code changes are automatically tested and deployed in a controlled manner.

### **8. Documentation**

- Document code thoroughly, including setup instructions, API usage, and deployment guidelines.
- Provide a user manual for consortium members detailing how to participate in the signing process and manage credentials.
